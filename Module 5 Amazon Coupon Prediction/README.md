Based on the above calculations we can conclude that:

    1. most drivers who accept expensive restaurant coupons go to expensive restaurants more than 3 times per month,
    2. none of the rivers who go more than 1 times per month at expensive restaurants accept coupons when driving with kids in the car,
    3. most of the drivers who go 4 times or more a month to restaurants are older than 25 and make less than $100k per year"

  Brief Report that highlights the differences between drivers who accept coupons and those who do not:
  The above data frame looks at drivers who accept or do not coupons to a variety of places such as cafes, bars, cheaper restaurants, and more expensive restaurants.
  My analysis concentrates primarily on drivers who accept coupons to bars and drivers who accept coupons to more expensive restaurants (prices ranging between 20-50)
    
**Key findings** 

**Bar Goers**:
    1. most drivers who accept coupons for bars are not widowed and don't have as passengers kids at the moment of accepting the coupon.
    2. most drivers who accept bar coupons go to bars more than once a month, with the majority going more than 3 times per month.
    3. almost half the drivers who accept bar coupons are younger than 40.
    4. most of the drivers who accept bar coupons and attend bars at least once a month earn less than USD 50,000 per year.

    1. most drivers who accept expensive restaurant coupons go to expensive restaurants more than 3 times per month.
    2. none of the rivers who go more than 1 times per month at expensive restaurant accept coupons when driving with kids in the car,
    3. most of the drivers who go 4 times or more a month to restaurants are older than 25 and make less than USD100k per year"
