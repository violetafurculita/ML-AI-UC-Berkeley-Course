### Project Title - Use Machine Learning Models to help predict credit card payments default


**Violeta Furculita**

#### Executive summary

#### Rationale
Why should anyone care about this question?

#### Research Question
Can Machine Learning models accurately predict whether credit card customers will default or not on their payments?

#### Data Sources
UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository -
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients

#### Methodology
* Preprocessing of data
* Feature selection and extraction for model training 
* Split data into train and test datasets
* Build a baseline model
* Build, train, and test a couple of different models to determine the best model to predict the default of credit card payments
* Fine-tune the selected model to increase accuracy rates
