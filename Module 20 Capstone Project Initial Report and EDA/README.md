### Project Title - Use Machine Learning Models to help predict credit card payments default


**Violeta Furculita**

#### Executive summary
**Context**:
- Credit cards are lines of credit extended to customers to use for everyday purchases
- Most customers make monthly payments toward the principal and interest charged, where applicable. Some customers may forgo making payments due to financial distress or intent to commit fraud
Credit cards are a major revenue stream for financial institutions
Even small increases in default rates can lead to significant losses
Being able to accurately predict which customers may default allows targeted risk management

**Problem**:
Conventional methods of predicting the likelihood of default at underwriting or during usage may not be well-equipped to predict default
Identifying at-risk customers early allows contact and/or appropriate loss management 
However, default risk depends on complex interactions of many customer attributes

#### Rationale
Why should anyone care about this question?

#### Research Question
Can Machine Learning models accurately predict whether credit card customers will default or not on their payments?

#### Data Sources
[UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients)

#### Methodology
* Preprocessing of data
* Feature selection and extraction for model training 
* Split data into train and test datasets
* Build a baseline model
* Build, train, and test a couple of different models to determine the best model to predict the default of credit card payments
* Fine-tune the selected model to increase accuracy rates
