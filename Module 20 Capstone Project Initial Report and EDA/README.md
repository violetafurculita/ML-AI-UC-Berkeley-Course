### Project Title - Use Machine Learning Models to help predict credit card payments default


**Violeta Furculita**

#### Executive summary


#### Rationale
**Context**:
- Credit cards are lines of credit extended to customers to use for everyday purchases
- Most customers make monthly payments toward the principal and interest charged, where applicable. Some customers may forgo making payments due to financial distress or intent to commit fraud
- Credit cards are a major revenue stream for financial institutions
- Even small increases in default rates can lead to significant losses
- Being able to accurately predict which customers may default allows targeted risk management

**Problem**:
- Conventional methods of predicting the likelihood of default at underwriting or during usage may not be well-equipped to predict default
- Identifying at-risk customers early allows contact and/or appropriate loss management 
- However, default risk depends on complex interactions of many customer attributes

#### Research Question
Can Machine Learning models accurately predict whether credit card customers will default on their payments?

#### Data Sources
[UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients)

#### Methodology
* Preprocessing of data
* Feature selection and extraction for model training 
* Split data into train and test datasets
* Build a baseline model
* Build, train, and test a couple of different models to determine the best model to predict the default of credit card payments
* Fine-tune the selected model to increase accuracy rates

#### Results
- We can easily train and test some out-of-the-box models that can offer pretty decent test accuracy rates and train times.
- We can further finetune each model to get better model performance

#### Next steps
- perform more modeling and hyper tuning of the models
- look at model ensembles such as boosting to enhance model performance
- determine which customer data features are most useful to building these models so we can optimize for accuracy and train time
