**Executive summary**
Predicting Credit Card Payment Defaults: The Need for High Accuracy Machine Learning Models

- As reported by the New York Fed, credit card delinquency rates surged over 50% in 2023, indicating growing financial stress among consumers. Total U.S. household debt also rose to $17.5 trillion, with credit card balances increasing sharply.

- For financial institutions, higher default rates translate directly to lost revenue, increased collection expenses and damage to balance sheets. Even small increases in defaults across large portfolios can result in substantial losses.

- Traditional tools like FICO scores are lagging indicators that do not capture changing repayment behaviors in a rising rate environment. Forward-looking predictive models are needed to preempt defaults through targeted interventions.

- Machine learning approaches can discover complex patterns across thousands of customer attributes. Models that accurately predict defaults 1-3 statements in advance allow contact of at-risk accounts with customized offers or counseling to improve outcomes.

- By reducing defaults, financial institutions can mitigate risks, optimize underwriting, and safeguard profits during periods of economic stress. Machine learning therefore offers a strategic solution to stay ahead of default trends, protect profits, and strengthen customer relationships.

- Accurate predictive models are more important than ever for credit risk management. This underscores the need for further developing and implementing advanced analytical capabilities.

Rationale
**Context**:

- Credit cards are lines of credit extended to customers to use for everyday purchases
- Most customers make monthly payments toward the principal and interest charged, where applicable. Some customers may forgo making payments due to financial distress or intent to commit fraud
- Credit cards are a major revenue stream for financial institutions
- Even small increases in default rates can lead to significant losses
- Being able to accurately predict which customers may default allows targeted risk management

**Problem:**

- Conventional methods of predicting the likelihood of default at underwriting or during usage may not be well-equipped to predict default
- Identifying at-risk customers early allows contact and/or appropriate loss management
- However, default risk depends on complex interactions of many customer attributes

**Research Question**
Can Machine Learning models accurately predict whether credit card customers will default on their payments?

**Data Sources**
UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository

**Methodology**
- Preprocessing of data
- Feature selection and extraction for model training
- Split data into train and test datasets
- Build a baseline model
- Build, train, and test a couple of different models to determine the best model to predict the default of credit card payments
- Fine-tune the selected model to increase accuracy rates

**Results**
We have further fine-tuned the models run before in Module 20 and have achieved the following results.
