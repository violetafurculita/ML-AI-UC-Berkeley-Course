**Overview:**
In this assignment, our goal is to compare the performance of the classifiers (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines) we encountered in this section of the program. We will use a dataset related to the marketing of bank products over the telephone.

**Data:**
The dataset used comes from the UCI Machine Learning repository [Links to an external site](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing). The data is from a Portuguese banking institution and is a collection of the results of multiple marketing campaigns. We can make use of the article accompanying the dataset (in the .zip file) for more information on the data and features.

**Deliverables:**
After understanding, preparing, and modeling the data, build a Jupyter Notebook that includes a clear statement demonstrating your understanding of the business problem, a correct and concise interpretation of descriptive and inferential statistics, our findings (including actionable insights), and next steps and recommendations.
